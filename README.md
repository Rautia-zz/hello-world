# hello-world
My first repository

My name is Antti Rauti
At the time of writing this, I'm studying and at Tampere University of Applied Sciences (16.2.2017)

I created my GitHub account to help with version control and to work as a data repository for school projects, and this spring's first big 
game project in particular.

So, hello world! and happy coding!
